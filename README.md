# Lattice-Innovations

* Each field that was mentioned is being taken into account. I've used the ROOM Database for storing details of the user. In the given assignment, since we don't have to deal with storing live data from a website, therefore I haven't converted user data in the form of the JSON object. 

* This App asks permission to get access to the location and show the current location of the user. The user can drag and drop custom location from the Google MapView as well.

* The SIGN_UP button only appears when all the fields are validated and remains invisible if the field's conditions don't match.

* On pressing the SIGN_UP button, the user is taken to the next activity where he gets a list of registered users with their details (Name, Email, Address, Phone Number).

* The next activity retrieves the list of the registered users and with the help of ADAPTER, the list view is setup into RECYCLER_VIEW.

## Extras

* The app colors scheme is inspired by your [website](https://www.thelattice.in/)

* Library 'com.hbb20:ccp:1.7.2' is used for Country Code feature.

Thank You

Yours Sincerely
